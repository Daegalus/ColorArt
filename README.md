# ColorArt for Java

iTunes 11-style color matching code

This is a port of the the [work done](https://github.com/panicinc/ColorArt) by Aaron Brethorst and Panic Inc to Java.

We have made it into a re-usable library so others can use it and comes with a simple GUI for testing directly.

This will not work with android without some rewriting, as this library relies heavily on java.awt.Color and java.awt.image.BufferedImage.
